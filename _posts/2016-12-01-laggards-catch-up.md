Got a text from Kyle this AM asking how the sprouts are doing. He had seen a little frost on the grass in the early AM. I do not think we had any temp below 35 F last night here. We benefit from the buffering of temperature changes by Lake Arlington. Our house sits near the top of the hill. Winds coming from the west are warmed by the lake water and carry that heat with them as they flow over us.

However, to be sure of our status I walked the plantings. The bottom half of the grass plot now has very tiny sprouts everywhere. They were not visible yesterday. The visible blade runs about 2 to 5 mm.I can't see evidence of roots but they must be there. Am simply not going to disturb them. Blake thinks the reason the bottom half of the plot sprouted late was due to surface drying in the areas that received the most sun. We did not place any top cover on the seeds on the advice of the Native American Seed folks. The fact of sprouting now makes that advice reasonable. On the other hand the commercial supplier of grass seed, Johnston Seed located in Oklahoma, recommends .25 to .75 inch of top cover. I think that might have provided better protection from drying. We might not have had any success at all if I had not been able to get the irrigation system repaired. Once that was done last week we have been able to water briefly every AM which hopefully balances the drying from the sun.

The concern now will be: Did we plant too late? Suspect 2 to 3 weeks earlier would have been much better. The weather forcasts suggest we may see a frost late next week. If that happens, how well will the little plants tolerate the frost? I expect that the sprouts that came up today are at significantly greater risk than the ones that came up earlier. We will see.

We also nearly violated several other recomendations from Johnston Seed. Planting season: March to May. Minimum soil temperature for germination: 50 - 55 F.

Our information from them came via phone conversation. The recommended fall planting, No top cover. Without the pictures and the scientific name, Bouteloua curtipendula, I would think we were talking about two different grasses!
