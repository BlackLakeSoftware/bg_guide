Blake has put in extraordinary hours creating a landscape in our yard that is beautiful, inviting, follows organic principles, uses native (to Texas) plants where possible, provides habitat for birds, butterflys, and other creatures, and has a light impact on water and other resources. This process has gone on for several years with guidance from several friends. Much has been learned but we have not kept much of a record. I began to realize that we have the ability to record Blake's work and to pull various references together into one source. This web site is the effort to do just that.

I hope that this site will make our work in the landscape easier and more effective for us and perhaps for others at some point in the future. It is a work in progress.


Enjoy!

Blake and Mitch Kuppinger
