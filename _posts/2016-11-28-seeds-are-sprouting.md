Hooray!! On the 25th I spotted very early sprouts from some of the wildflower seeds. These are growing visibly daily.

Today I found many very small sprouts from the grass seeds. The grass sprout in the picture is about 1 cm long. The sprouting seems to be mostly in the upper end of the planting area. This area gets less sun than the lower end which makes the sprouting there first a surprise. Have to think about why that might be. Certainly the seed distribution at planting was quite even. Did not think we altered the preparation much from top to bottom. Hmm??
