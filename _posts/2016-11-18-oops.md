Oops!! We dug up the lantana along side the walkway, prepared the beds, planted the seeds and then hand watered the beds. The next day I chose to water with the sprinkler system only to see this!:

The sprinkler heads on that section of the system barely had enough water pressure to pop up. This was the only section affected. Must have a leak somewhere. Probably where the lantana was dug out. So I turned on the sprinkler for ~ 10 minutes and found this:

<br><br>

Water is seeping out from under the cardboard layer. The leak must be uphill from where the seep is seen. I think I have pictures of the lantana before it was dug out and also believe I can identify where the plumbing crosses the bed. Should be able to find the leak without too much digging and probing. After repair will have to rebuild the layers over the repair site.

BTW. Though we have expected the Sideoats grama to begin to sprout by now there is no evidence of that happening. The [Johnston Seed Company][jsc] site indicates sprouting within 5 days. But ... They list these characteristics:

#### Plant Characteristics:

**Height:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  12 to 36 inches <br>
**Growth habit:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  bunchgrass, rhizomatous <br>
**Bloom period:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  late spring <br>
**Sun requirement:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  full sun <br>
**Leaf foliage color:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  bluish-green <br>
**Seeds per pound:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  180,000 <br>
**Minimum soil temperature for germination:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  50 to 55 oF <br>
**Soil pH range:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  5.5 to 8.5 <br>
**Planting Rate:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  1 PLS lb/3000 sq ft or 10 PLS lbs/acre <br>
**Planting Depth:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1⁄4 inch on clay soils, 3⁄4 inch on coarse soils <br>
**Planting season:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <span style="color:red">March to May</span> <br>

Note the Planting season entry. I think we won't see any action from these seeds until Spring. Oops again!

Also Johnston Seed Company recommends a planting depth ~ 3/4 inch. We spread the seeds on the surface. Presumably we need to put some soil over the seeds now. Oops!
