Blake and our occasional gardener, Kyle, have embarked on an effort to establish desirable grasses in a strip ~ 8' wide west of the walkway through the upper lot. If successful this will be extended further from the walkway.

The initial steps involve laying a layer of cardboard along the strip. This is soaked and then covered with compost and dirt to a depth of about 4". Various soil amendments have been added. A mulch layer will be added and the area again wet down. The desired grasses will be seeded into that area. Part of the compost has come from our composting bin but we have had to supplement commercially. Dirt will come from a pile of topsoil pulled off the lower lot several years ago when that area was planted with our Texas native sedge. That pile is believed to have had enough time to 'cook' and kill any seeds contained within it.

Planned grasses will be: [Sideoats grama](BOCU)
