Had an irrigation man come to the house to repair the leak that appeared under the fresh plantings. The control valve for that segment had been broken. Had to replace the valve body. Fortunately the parts were available on his truck and the repair was done quickly and at minimal expense.

It became apparent when we found the leak that the irrigation valve cover was hiden under our mulch/compost. Another lesson learned: Know where the valves are and make certain they are marked/visible. I will add a valve cover extension to raise its top to ~ 3 - 4 inches above ground level. Will need to find the others and map them. Prob also will add valve cover extensions to the others as well.

Will repair the damage done to the plantings later this week. Still watching for seed sproutings on the grass side. We are beginning to see some on the wildflower side.
